# Cornell Design and Tech Initiative: My Experience

## About the team

The Cornell Design and Tech Initiative (CDTI) is the premier school-sponsored, student-run software engineering project team at Cornell University. It boasts over 100 members and offers 8 different product offerings across campus.

## My Roles

During my time at CDTI, I held three different roles: Developer, Technical Product Manager, and Development Lead.

### Development Lead

-   Revamped and taught Trends in Web Development, a 2-credit student-run S/U course in full-stack web development.
-   Worked closely with Technical Product Managers and administrators to support the development and growth of sub-team products.
-   Created and executed a semester-long roadmap for social events, team assignments, and cross-team activities.
-   Maintained and improved the team-wide CI/CD workflow using Github Actions.

### Technical Product Manager

As Technical Product Manager for the Carriage sub-team, I led the development of a mobile and web platform to help impaired students find rides across campus.

-   Established a testing, staging, and deploy CI/CD pipeline using Github Actions, Jest, Docker, Heroku, AWS, and more.
-   Facilitated weekly stand-ups, code reviews, task distribution, and sprints in an Agile environment.
-   Audited and ensured the compliance of web-apps and mobile apps with accessibility standards.
-   Collaborated with CULift and Cornell University administration to test and deploy products in conjunction with official university services.

### Developer

As a Developer on the ClubView sub-team, I worked on building a platform to promote and discover student organizations on campus.

-   Built various frontend React components.
-   Re-designed and re-orchestrated the app-wide routing and data hierarchy for a more responsive and clean Navigation implementation.
